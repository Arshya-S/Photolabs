# Photolabs
The PhotoLabs project is a React SPA frontend heavy project heavily relying on the use of hooks to manage compoents and their state.

Photos can be liked with the heart button which will show a notification in the navigation bar heart icon. The user can click on different topics and sort the photos by topics. Photos can be clicked on to be able to see a larger picture as well as the similar photos based on the photo topic. Each photo has info about the user the posted including a profile picture and location.
